🛍️ Skardu App
A sleek front-end e-commerce application built using Flutter, designed to showcase a modern UI for online shopping. While this version focuses on the front-end only, it lays the foundation for a full-featured shopping experience.

👨‍💻 About Me
Hey there! I'm Muhammad Shamim Shoaib, a Computer Science student and passionate mobile app developer. This project is part of my learning journey into Flutter UI/UX design, where I focused on creating clean layouts, reusable components, and responsive design elements that mimic a real e-commerce experience.

What I learned and applied in this project:

Building responsive UI using Flutter widgets

Creating a product catalog layout

Organizing code using clean structure and best practices

Enhancing design through styling and user-centric components

This project reflects my growing interest in Flutter development, especially in building smooth, intuitive interfaces. I'm planning to integrate the backend in the future to make this a fully functional shopping app!
